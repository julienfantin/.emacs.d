      C-x C-k r apply-macro to region lines, this is better than trying to write a looping macro

    As of Emacs 24.1, there’s a new command ‘C-x r N’ (‘rectangle-number-lines’), that can be used to number the lines. Just mark a region which you want numbered and hit ‘C-x r N’. ‘C-u’ prefix works to start from any number you choose.
